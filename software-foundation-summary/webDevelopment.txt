1. Responsibilities of Front-End, Backend, and Database
Front-End (Client-Side)

The front-end is everything that users interact with directly. It focuses on user experience (UX) and user interface (UI).

Responsibilities:

Display data to users in a readable and interactive way.

Capture user input and send it to the backend.

Handle user interface logic such as form validation, animations, and responsiveness.

Technologies/Tools:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Frameworks: React, Angular, Vue, Blazor (for .NET)

Backend (Server-Side)

The backend manages the application logic and communication between the front-end and database.

Responsibilities:

Handle requests from the front-end.

Process business logic.

Validate data before storing it in the database.

Handle authentication and authorization.

Integrate with external services (APIs).

Technologies/Tools:

Programming languages: C#, Java, Python, Node.js

Frameworks: .NET, Spring Boot, Django, Express.js

Database

The database stores and organizes the data of the application.

Responsibilities:

Persistently store structured (SQL) or unstructured (NoSQL) data.

Provide querying capabilities to retrieve and manipulate data.

Ensure data integrity, consistency, and security.

Technologies/Tools:

SQL: SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL

NoSQL: MongoDB, Firebase

ORMs: Entity Framework Core (for .NET)

2. .NET Stack Tools

The .NET stack is a powerful ecosystem for building enterprise and web applications. Key tools include:

SQL Server

A relational database management system (RDBMS) by Microsoft.

Stores structured data in tables.

Supports transactions, stored procedures, indexing, and advanced querying.

Works seamlessly with .NET applications.

C#

The main programming language for .NET applications.

Object-oriented and type-safe.

Compiled into Intermediate Language (IL) which runs on the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR).

Used for backend logic, web APIs, desktop applications, and even front-end through Blazor.

Entity Framework Core (EF Core)

An Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET.

Converts database tables into C# objects and vice versa.

Reduces the need to write raw SQL.

Supports LINQ queries for powerful and readable data operations.

LINQ (Language Integrated Query)

Allows querying data directly in C# in a readable and type-safe way.

Can be used on:

Databases (via EF Core)

Collections in memory

XML, JSON

Example: var users = dbContext.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 18);

Blazor

A front-end framework in .NET for building interactive web apps using C# instead of JavaScript.

Two hosting models:

Blazor Server: Runs on the server; updates sent via SignalR.

Blazor WebAssembly: Runs entirely in the browser.

Enables full-stack C# development, meaning developers can use the same language for front-end and backend.
